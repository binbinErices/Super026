**软件工程师的衰落，程序员技术人员的崛起**

Most of the people I know are software engineers or computer scientists of one form or another. Most of them are very experienced and come from a time when to be either of those things required a very serious computer science education. Of course this is still the case for being a computer scientist, but seemingly not so for programming. Many of my well seasoned colleges lament the decline in skill and education of their younger peers. I also have seen this shift in the skill set and education of entry level programming candidates both on-the-job and in the classroom. It seems as if software engineering as a discipline and profession has given way to “hacking” and “cowboy” developers who know very little actual computer science. Has something changed? If so, what?

我认识的大多数人都是某个领域的软件工程师或计算机科学家。 他们中的大多数人都非常有经验，并且来自于其中任何一件事都需要非常认真的计算机科学教育的时代。 当然，作为计算机科学家仍然如此，但对于编程来说似乎并非如此。 我周边有名的大学都对年轻同龄人的技能和教育水平下降感到遗憾。 我还看到了在职和在课堂上入门级程序设计候选人的技能和教育上的这种转变。 似乎软件工程作为一门学科和专业已经让位给了对真正的计算机科学知之甚少的“黑客”和“牛仔”开发人员。 有什么改变吗？ 如果是这样，该怎么办？

### **History 101**

If you go back to the beginnings of computer science, it was not called computer science and there was no computer science department in any school. Computer science as a discipline was a subset of mathematics and/or engineering. The first computer science department was established in 1962 at Purdue University, and it was another 15 years before there was even a just a small handful of University computer science departments. Well into the 1980's, computer science was still mostly considered a sub-field of mathematics or general engineering. However, we had computer programmers as early as the 1940’s. Who were these early pioneers and what did they do?

如果您回到计算机科学的起源，它就不被称为计算机科学，并且在任何学校中都没有计算机科学系。 计算机科学作为一门学科是数学和/或工程学的子集。 第一个计算机科学系于1962年在普渡大学成立，距此再过15年，甚至只有一小部分大学有计算机科学系。 到了20世纪80年代，计算机科学仍被广泛认为是数学或通用工程的一个子领域。 但是，我们早在20世纪40年代就拥有计算机程序员。 这些早期的开拓者是谁，他们做了什么？

Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace; aka [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace). The first of us. Mom.

The first programmers were mathematicians. They weren’t usually called programmers. They were analysts, engineers, mathematicians, or just generally “*those really smart women over there in the refrigerator*” (most of the first programmers were women and most computers were in “cold rooms”). These “programmers” had to have extensive formal education and knowledge in mathematics and/or engineering. Most were more closely related to scientists than what we think of as programmers today. Over time, and by the late 1960's, the field grew and the people involved in programming computers became known as software engineers. These were very highly educated people (still mostly women), usually with advanced degrees in math. This continued for some time.

最早的程序员是数学家。 他们通常不被称为程序员。 他们是分析师，工程师，数学家，或者通常只是“ *那些真的很聪明的女人在冰箱里*”（大多数第一批程序员是女人，大多数计算机都在“冷室”中）。 这些“程序员”必须具有广泛的正规教育和数学和/或工程知识。 与我们今天所认为的程序员相比，大多数人与科学家的关系更紧密。 随着时间的流逝，到20世纪60年代后期，这一领域发展壮大，从事计算机编程的人员逐渐被称为软件工程师。 这些人是受过高等教育的人（仍然大部分是女性），通常具有较高的数学学位。 这持续了一段时间。

[Margaret Hamilton](http://margaret_hamilton/), one of the first true software engineers and one of the greatest.

By the 1980's, computer science departments and degrees were beginning to take hold in colleges and universities. Some consider this the golden age of computer science. Personal computers were showing up in homes across America, movies like [WarGames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames) intrigued people and made them want to learn more about computers, and rumors about something called “The Internet” were scaring the hell out of people. During this period we saw the rise of the formal and traditional software engineer. It was a coveted and respected title, and only those formally educated in mathematics, computer science, and/or electrical engineering were allowed to carry it. This also lasted for some time.

到20世纪80年代，计算机科学系和学位开始在大学和大学中占有一席之地。 有人认为这是计算机科学的黄金时代。 个人计算机出现在美国各地的家庭中，类似WarGames的电影引起了人们的兴趣，使他们想了解有关计算机的更多信息，以及有关“互联网”的传言， 吓坏了人们。 在此期间，我们看到了正规和传统软件工程师的兴起。 这是一个令人垂涎且受人尊敬的头衔，只有那些在数学，计算机科学和/或电气工程方面受过正规教育的人才能获准使用。 这也持续了一段时间。

### **Something Changed**

By the end of the 1990's we began to see the first of whom we now simply call “programmers,” “coders,” and “developers.” These were people who instead of formal University degrees had credentials like military technical training or an associate’s degree in hands-on programming, or were simply self-taught thanks to the Internet. Slowly this new group entered the field of software engineering with new titles such as “programmer” or “developer” as opposed to “engineer.” We also saw an explosion in computer related technical fields such as network specialists and system administrators.

20世纪90年代末，我们开始看到我们中的第一批人，我们现在简称为“程序员”，“编码员”和“开发人员”。这些人不是正式的大学学位，而是拥有军事技术训练或肆业证书等证书的 在动手编程中，或者只是由于互联网而自学成才。 这个新团队慢慢进入了软件工程领域，并以“程序员”或“开发人员”之类的新标题代替了“工程师”。我们还看到了与计算机相关的技术领域的爆炸式增长，例如网络专家和系统管理员。

Even up to the early 2000's, as a hiring manager, I almost never saw any application for a software engineering job where the applicant did not have a related four-year degree. If I did, I would have thrown it out without thinking about it. Fast forward to the late 2010's and at least half the applications I saw were from people with no formal degree. Now as a professor of computer science I regularly have students who drop out after a class or two because they got a job as a programmer of some sort (usually not a good job, and not a job for which they are ready, but a job with the title “developer” nonetheless).

直到21世纪初，作为一名招聘经理，我几乎从未见过任何软件工程工作的申请，而申请人没有相关的四年制学位。 如果我这样做了，我会把它扔出去而不考虑它。 快进到2010年底，我看到的申请中至少有一半来自没有正式学位的人。 现在，作为计算机科学教授，我经常让学生在一两节课后辍学，因为他们获得了某种类型的程序员的工作（通常不是一项好工作，不是他们已经准备好的工作，而是一份工作。 然而工作仍以“开发人员”为标题）。

![img](https://github.com/binbinErices/Super026/blob/master/Reading/img/week01/03.jpg)

Maybe a couple more programming classes would have been a good idea? Nah!

The title “software engineer” has either fallen out of favor or is reserved for traditional and senior roles in large tech corporations. Now it’s usually “developer” or “programmer” that you see advertised as a job title, or the unfortunately absurd and comical “hacker,” “code-ninja,” or “code-guru.” We also see the ridiculous “[full stack developer](https://medium.com/@alexkatrompas/the-hard-truth-about-the-full-stack-developer-myths-and-lies-945ffadeeb8c)” title thrown around, as if that has some special meaning (it doesn’t). A degree is no longer necessarily an indicator of fitness for a programmer job, and in fact no formal education is necessarily required. Standards seem to be in sharp decline, to the point where anyone who can type is now a “programmer.”

“软件工程师”的称号已经不受欢迎，或者保留给大型高科技公司的传统和高级职位。 现在，您通常会以“开发人员”或“程序员”的身份标榜为职位，或者不幸地是荒谬而可笑的“黑客”，“代码忍者”或“代码大师”。我们还看到了荒谬的“ 全栈开发者”标题，好像有一些特殊之处 意思（不是）。 学位不再是适合程序员工作的指标，而且实际上也不需要正式的教育。 标准似乎正在急剧下降，以至于现在任何人都可以打字成为“程序员”。

### **What Happened?**

For many old schoolers, the typical conclusion and argument is that standards have simply declined. It’s obvious that the demand for anyone who can program (even rudimentarily) has skyrocketed. The typical argument is that someone has to do it, so we lowered the bar just to put bodies behind keyboards. On the surface it makes sense. Very few people are fit for four year degrees in the hard sciences and fewer still for advanced degrees in disciplines like math, engineering, and computer science.

对于许多高中生来说，典型的结论和论点是标准只是下降了。 显然，对任何可以编程的人（甚至是技能不成熟的的人）的需求都在猛增。 典型的论点是有人必须这样做，因此我们降低了门槛，只是将主体放在键盘后面。 从表面上看，这是有道理的。 很少有人能在硬科学领域获得四年制学位，而在数学，工程学和计算机科学等领域却能获得高级学位的人才很少。

Obviously it’s become about simple numbers. The demand for developers is absurdly high, the number of people who are capable of getting a four year degree in computer science is relatively low, and we need programmers in the field right now. We have to fill the demand somehow, so we just lower the standards. Apparently, now we just let anyone “engineer” and we blindly hope for the best. Seemingly, true software engineering is disappearing while “coding” and “hacking” with little formal education is taking its place. That’s a simple answer which many formally trained engineers would like to believe (including me). However, like most simple answers, we should look deeper before making a conclusion.

显然，这已经成为简单数字了。 对开发人员的需求非常高，能够获得四年制计算机科学学位的人数相对较少，我们现在需要该领域的程序员。 我们必须以某种方式满足需求，因此我们只是降低了标准。 显然，现在我们只允许任何人“工程师”，我们盲目地希望最好。 看起来，真正的软件工程正在消失，而很少受正规教育的“编码”和“黑客”正取而代之。 这是一个简单的答案，许多经过正式培训的工程师都想相信（包括我在内）。 但是，像大多数简单的答案一样，我们在得出结论之前应该更深入地研究。

What really happened is computer technology matured, modularized, and productized. We used to require highly trained, formally educated software engineers in all aspects of computing because the number of computers in a business or institution was… one. One very big, very complicated, and very expensive computer. There were no networks as we think of them today and no Internet. The individuals who worked on these machines had to be all-in-one scientists, engineers, and mathematicians. The rigors of these early jobs were incredibly intense because the technology itself was immature and largely experimental. As computer technology matured it became modular, productized, and packaged (like any technology). No longer would one person have to be all-in-one mathematician, engineer, programmer, network administrator, and database administrator. Technologies became plug-and-play and so did the jobs for them. Technical roles (like the technology itself) became broken up among many focus-trained specialists rather than a few highly educated generalists.

真正发生的事情是计算机技术的成熟，模块化和产品化。我们曾经需要在计算的各个方面都训练有素，受过正式教育的软件工程师，因为企业或机构中的计算机数量是……一台非常大，非常复杂且非常昂贵的计算机。今天没有我们想到的网络，也没有互联网。在这些机器上工作的个人必须是多位科学家，工程师和数学家。这些早期工作的严酷程度令人难以置信，因为该技术本身还不成熟且在很大程度上处于试验阶段。随着计算机技术的成熟，它变得模块化，产品化和包装化（就像任何技术一样）。不再需要一个人成为数学家，工程师，程序员，网络管理员和数据库管理员。技术变得即插即用，因此他们的工作也随之而来。技术角色（例如技术本身）在许多受过重点培训的专家中而不是在少数受过高等教育的通才中被分解。

Found the bug! [It’s a moth](https://interestingengineering.com/the-origin-of-the-term-computer-bug).

This happens in all fields. The first days are reserved for the visionaries and the most talented and educated. The early days are then populated by only the most serious minds with formal education because each person has to have full knowledge of the entire field. Consider the early days of the automotive industry (before it was an industry); only those with a serious understanding of metallurgy and engineering could build, design, or fix an automobile. Building or fixing an automobile in the early 1900's could literally require knowledge and skill in blacksmithing, metallurgy, fabrication, engineering, physics, and chemistry (formal education or not, you still had to know a lot). In the 1930–40's, demand for automobiles skyrocketed, the assembly line was invented, and modular parts were created. Today, the average worker on an assembly line producing automobiles has little to no knowledge of the engineering and metallurgy that goes into an automobile, let alone the computer science also now needed to control the vehicle. Similarly we have automotive technicians that have little to no knowledge of engineering or metallurgy (or computer science). They use diagnostic equipment to tell them the problem, they order parts online, and they swap out the parts. These technicians and assembly line workers are trained and skilled, but in a completely different fashion from a mechanical engineer or a metallurgist. This has now happened in the computer science and software engineering fields — because it *had* to happen.

这发生在所有领域。前几天是为有远见的人和最有才华和受过教育的人保留的。最初，只有最认真的思想家接受过正规教育，因为每个人都必须对整个领域有全面的了解。考虑一下汽车行业的早期（在成为一个行业之前）；只有对冶金和工程学有深刻理解的人才能制造，设计或修理汽车。在1900年代初期制造或修理汽车实际上可能需要锻造，冶金，制造，工程，物理和化学方面的知识和技能（无论是否接受正规教育，您仍然需要了解很多知识）。在1930至40年代，对汽车的需求猛增，发明了装配线，并创建了模块化零件。如今，生产汽车的装配线上的普通工人几乎不了解汽车的工程技术和冶金学知识，更不用说现在还需要计算机科学来控制汽车。同样，我们的汽车技术人员几乎不了解工程或冶金（或计算机科学）知识。他们使用诊断设备告诉他们问题所在，他们在线订购零件，然后更换零件。这些技术人员和装配线工人受过训练和熟练，但与机械工程师或冶金师完全不同。现在这已经在计算机科学和软件工程领域发生了-因为它必须发生。

### **Programming Technicians**

Just as in the automotive example, the demand for skilled workers in programming skyrocketed. At the same time, computers and software became modular, packaged, and productized. We have also seen explosive growth in the areas related to computer science such as networking, system administration, encryption, databases, electrical engineering, etc. We simply cannot afford to have everyone in the computer field be a highly trained computer scientist and mathematician, just as we could not build or fix cars if every assembly line worker and mechanic was required to have a master’s degree in mechanical engineering. It just doesn’t work that way.

就像在汽车行业的例子中一样，对熟练的编程人员的需求也在飞速增长。 同时，计算机和软件变得模块化，打包和生产。 我们还看到了与计算机科学相关的领域的爆炸性增长，例如网络，系统管理，加密，数据库，电气工程等。我们根本无法让计算机领域的每个人都成为训练有素的计算机科学家和数学家， 因为如果每个流水线工人和机械师都需要拥有机械工程硕士学位，我们就无法制造或修理汽车。 那样行不通。

More and more, what we have today behind computer keyboards are analogous to the skilled and trained automotive technician (as opposed to a formally trained mechanical engineer). The “coder” or “developer” is more and more someone without formal or extensive computer science education. Instead, this is a person that has been trained specifically in programming as a technical skill, and also has some foundational computer science education, but primarily as it relates directly to programming. Programming today no longer takes place in a free-for-all complex and experimental environment that requires extensive and formal computer science education. A lot of programming today requires something analogous to the automotive technician, the ability to identify the part that is needed, know where to find the part, and plug it in properly. A day-to-day programmer no longer needs to know how to design and construct a sorting or searching algorithm and analyze its performance mathematically before implementing it. A programmer simply finds the sort or search “part” and plugs it in.

*What we are seeing is not the demise of the true software engineer or computer scientist, what we are seeing is the rise of the programmer technician.*

These new skilled workers are those with basic computer science knowledge, but only as it relates directly to programming along with hands-on training in programming.

如今，计算机键盘背后的功能越来越类似于熟练且受过训练的汽车技术人员（相对于受过正规培训的机械工程师）。 “编码人员”或“开发人员”越来越多地没有经过正规或广泛的计算机科学教育。取而代之的是，这是一个经过专门编程训练的技术人员，并且还接受了一些基础的计算机科学教育，但主要是因为它直接与编程有关。今天的编程不再在需要广泛而正式的计算机科学教育的免费的复杂实验环境中进行。如今，许多编程工作都需要类似于汽车技术人员的能力，识别所需零件，知道在哪里找到零件并正确插入的能力。日常程序员不再需要知道如何设计和构造排序或搜索算法，并在实现之前就进行数学分析。程序员只需找到排序或搜索“零件”并将其插入即可。

*我们所看到的不是真正的软件工程师或计算机科学家的消亡，我们所看到的是程序员技术人员的兴起。*

这些新技术工人是具有基本计算机科学知识的人员，但仅与编程直接相关，并且具有编程方面的动手培训。

### **True Computer Science and Software Engineering: Alive and Well**

Computer scientists and true software engineers have not been supplanted by “coders,” “developers,” and “hackers.” We’re simply re-organizing our professions and positions into what is a maturing industry. Thanks to computer scientists, engineers, and mathematicians in the first place, the programming technician (i.e. the modern “developer” or “coder”) is now possible. Building software is now modular and mostly pre-packaged and prescribed thanks to advances in computer science that have led to extensive software libraries, package managers, dependency managers, integrated development environments, software-as-a-service, infrastructure-as-a-service, distributed code repositories, and of course the Internet; all of which started with PhD’s and engineers in computer science research labs. Furthermore, programming languages like Python have abstracted away details to such a degree, almost anyone can do it with just basic computer science knowledge.

计算机科学家和真正的软件工程师并没有被“编码人员”，“开发人员”和“黑客”所取代。我们只是将我们的专业和职位重新组织成一个日趋成熟的行业。 首先要感谢计算机科学家，工程师和数学家，现在才有可能使用编程技术人员（即现代的“开发人员”或“编码人员”）。 借助计算机科学的进步，构建软件现在已模块化，并且大多已预先打包和规定，这导致了广泛的软件库，软件包管理器，依赖项管理器，集成开发环境，软件即服务，基础架构即是 服务，分布式代码存储库，当然还有Internet； 所有这些都是从博士和计算机科学研究实验室的工程师开始的。 此外，诸如Python之类的编程语言已经将细节抽象化到一定程度，几乎任何人都可以仅凭基本的计算机科学知识就可以使用它。

![img](https://github.com/binbinErices/Super026/blob/master/Reading/img/week01/06.jpg)

Computer scientists are still hard at work building new theories and new technologies. Formally educated software engineers with degrees in computer science are still building those theories into reality. However, now as those new technologies filter down to those on the front lines; it’s the programmer technicians who do the bulk of the day-to-day heavy lifting in software development.

计算机科学家仍在努力建立新的理论和新技术。具有计算机科学学位的受过正式教育的软件工程师仍在将这些理论变为现实。但是，现在随着这些新技术的发展，其影响力逐渐下降到第一线。在软件开发中，每天繁重的工作都是程序员技术人员。

Computer scientists, mathematicians, and software engineers who are formally educated with advanced degrees in computer science are still here, and the demand for them is higher than ever, they’re just a little harder to spot as a proportion of the total number of people in the field. Formal engineers and scientists use to make up 100% of the people in the industry. Now they make up a smaller and smaller percentage. Not because they are being replaced, but because thanks to those formally trained computer scientists and software engineers there is a new high-demand job created; the programmer technician.

仍然接受过计算机科学高级学位的计算机科学家，数学家和软件工程师仍在这里，并且对他们的需求比以往任何时候都高，因此在总人数中所占的比例更难找到 在该领域。 正式的工程师和科学家用来组成该行业的100％的人员。 现在，它们所占的比例越来越小。 不是因为他们被替换，而是因为有了那些经过正式培训的计算机科学家和软件工程师，新的高要求工作才得以创建。 程序员技术员。

Not only has the true software engineer and computer scientist not fallen, we’re still here and doing better than ever. We just have a new colleague we should welcome with open arms, because let’s face it, they are in the trenches doing most of the work now.

真正的软件工程师和计算机科学家不但没有堕落，我们还在这里，并且比以往任何时候都做得更好。 我们只有一个新同事，我们应该张开双臂欢迎，因为面对现实吧，他们现在正从事大部分工作。

###  **Now It’s Your Choice**

Thanks to explosive growth in technology, and the work of those early pioneers in software engineering, an entire generation of people can now have lucrative and engaging careers in what used to be an almost inaccessible field. Just as the automotive and manufacturing revolution of the 1930–40's led to the creation of the middle class and an unprecedented rise in living standards, the IT revolution of the 2000's is doing the same thing. We’re seeing the democratization of computer science and this is a good thing.

得益于技术的爆炸性增长以及软件工程的早期开拓者的工作，如今，整个一代人现在可以在过去几乎无法进入的领域中拥有丰厚而引人入胜的职业。 就像1930至40年代的汽车和制造业革命导致中产阶级的建立和生活水平的空前提高一样，2000年代的IT革命也在做同样的事情。 我们正在看到计算机科学的民主化，这是一件好事。

![img](https://github.com/binbinErices/Super026/blob/master/Reading/img/week01/07.jpg)

The choice is now yours. Almost everyone can be part of the continued technical revolution and secure a well paying and engaging career in technology. The choice now is not *if* you can be in the tech industry, now it’s about *where* and *what* level in the industry do you want to be and *how* do you get there? PhD’s in computer science are still researching and coming up with new theories every day. Those with advanced degrees in math and computer science are still testing and implementing those theories into real and practical technologies. Formally trained and educated software engineers with computer science degrees are the software architects and leaders in the field. Programming technicians (i.e. the modern coders, developers, and programmers) are on the front lines putting the parts in place and assembling and maintaining the systems, while analysts and administrators support them.

现在是您的选择。 几乎每个人都可以参与不断的技术革命，并确保获得高薪和引人入胜的技术职业。 现在的选择不是*如果*您可以从事科技行业，而是关于您想成为该行业的*地点*和*什么*水平，以及*如何*到达那里？ 计算机科学博士学位仍然每天都在研究并提出新的理论。 那些拥有数学和计算机科学高级学位的人仍在测试并将这些理论应用于实际和实际技术中。 具有计算机科学学位的经过正式培训和受过教育的软件工程师是该领域的软件架构师和领导者。 编程技术人员（即，现代编码人员，开发人员和程序员）处在最前沿，将零件放置到位并组装和维护系统，而分析师和管理员则为他们提供支持。

Unlike the early days where only the most highly trained and educated could even think of entering the computing field, now you can choose your education level, and choose or change your place at will by advancing your education. However, just to be clear, if you want to code for a living, you still can’t get out of attaining some foundational knowledge in computer science, and you still have to have an [affinity for the skills and lifestyle](https://medium.com/@alexkatrompas/so-you-want-to-be-a-programmer-bf55bfc671c2). It’s still not easy. It’s just that now it’s your choice where you start and how far you will go.

不同于早期，只有受过最高培训和受过良好教育的人甚至可以考虑进入计算领域，现在您可以选择自己的教育水平，并通过推进教育随意选择或改变自己的位置。 但是，需要明确的是，如果您想以谋生为编码，那么您仍然无法摆脱对计算机科学的一些基础知识，并且仍然必须具有[技能和生活方式的相似性]（https： //medium.com/@alexkatrompas/so-you-want-to-a-programmer-bf55bfc671c2）。 仍然不容易。 只是现在，您可以选择从哪里开始以及走多远。
