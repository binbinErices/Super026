I am sure everybody would have heard about the great Archimedes and his eureka moment.

我相信每个人都会听说过伟大的阿基米德和他的尤里卡时刻。

As the story goes, the king asks Archimedes to determine if a present he has received is actually solid gold. The problem tortured Archimedes for weeks, and he could not find an answer to it. He became frustrated, couldn’t sleep, and felt worthless. His wife, seeing his pitiable situation, convinced him to relax and take a bath.

随着故事的发展，国王请阿基米德确定他收到的礼物是否真的是纯金。 这个问题折磨了阿基米德几个星期，他找不到答案。 他变得沮丧，无法入睡，并感到一文不值。 他的妻子看到他的可怜处境，说服他放松并洗个澡。

The rest, as we know, is history. Archimedes solved the problem. He screams “Eureka!” and he was so overwhelmed that he ran dripping naked through the streets to the king’s palace to report his discovery.

众所周知，剩下的就是历史了。 阿基米德解决了这个问题。 他大喊“尤里卡！”，他十分激动，以至于赤裸裸地穿过街道流向国王的宫殿，以报告他的发现。

So what is the lesson we learn here?

我们可以从这里学到什么呢?

Creative breakthroughs can happen at any time? No.

创新性的突破可以在任何时候发生吗？并不是。

The one big glaring lesson we learn here is to pay attention to our lives. It will help us not only to feel better but will also pay rich dividends at work.

我们在这里学到的一大教训是关注生活。 它不仅可以帮助我们感觉好些，而且可以在工作中带来丰厚的回报。

That brings us to the cardinal question of work-life balance. Far too many software developers I know compartmentalize their lives into two separate lives. One is the work-life, in which they slog, tolerate, and even sometimes enjoy what they are doing.

那把我们带到了工作与生活平衡的根本问题上。 我知道太多的软件开发人员将他们的生活分成两个单独的生活。 一种是工作生活，他们在其中苦苦挣扎，宽容甚至有时享受他们所做的事情。

The other one is the life-life, in which they aim to spend time with their families and personal pursuits outside work. There is nothing wrong with this approach, except that in the real-life scenario, this compartmentation will not work. That is why the concept of work-life balance is a myth. You can never divide your life into two neat buckets and expect that the two will not meet.

另一个是生活，他们的目标是与家人和工作以外的个人生活在一起。 这种方法没有什么问题，除了在现实情况下，这种分隔不会起作用。 这就是为什么工作与生活平衡的概念是一个神话。 您永远不能将自己的生活分成两个整洁的桶，并期望这两个桶不会相遇。

Not convinced? Let us do the math. We all have 24 hours, and we have seven days a week.

- Work hours (minimum): 8 hours

-  Commute hours: 2 hours

- Sleep hours: 8 hours

不服气吗？ 让我们做数学。 我们每个人都有24小时，我们每周有7天。

- 工作时间（最少）：8小时

- 通勤时间：2小时

- 睡眠时间：8小时

So that leaves us with 6 hours a day to live our life the way we want to, to relax, and to do whatever creatively we want to do with our lives. That is not much of a life, to begin with.

这样一来，我们每天就有6个小时可以按照自己想要的方式生活，放松和做自己想做的与生活相关的事情。 首先，这不是生活。

Wait. What about the weekends? Some of us have two glorious weekend days for doing nothing and being free from stress. The weekends will go like this:

- Sleep hours: 16 hours

- Paying bills (which you don’t find time to do on weekdays): 2 hours

等等， 周末呢？ 我们中有些人有两个光荣的周末，无所事事，没有压力。 周末将像这样：

- 睡眠时间：16小时

- 支付帐单（您在工作日找不到时间）：2小时

So we are left with 30 hours on the weekends. So my point is, if you are planning to spend your next 30 years fighting to preserve your six hours of life every day and 30 hours on weekends, you are running after a utopian dream.

所以我们周末有30个小时。 因此，我的意思是，如果您打算花费接下来的30年时间来捍卫每天六小时的生命，并在周末保持30个小时，那么您正在追求一个空想。

Things beyond your control happen in both life and work. There’s that all-nighter at office, the go-live on weekends, and the production issue that has kept you awake throughout the night and at home. Or maybe your loved one is not well, and you need to take off. Life and work are full of challenges, which are thrown at us with regular intervals without respite.

在您的生活和工作中都发生了您无法控制的事情。 办公室里通宵达旦，周末上班，而生产问题使您整夜都无法入睡。 也许您所爱的人身体不好，您需要起飞。 生活和工作充满挑战，每隔一段时间就会无休止地向我们抛出挑战。

So expecting things to function like clockwork and compartmentalizing life and work is always a bad idea. Your work is very much a part of your life, and you have to accept that truth. By pursuing the hopeless dream of achieving work-life balance, you will end up even more frustrated, tired, and unhappy. Instead, focus on improving the quality of life. Ask yourself these questions:

因此，期望诸如时钟之类的事物能够正常运转并分隔生活和工作始终是一个坏主意。 您的工作是您生活中不可或缺的一部分，您必须接受这个真理。 通过追求实现工作与生活平衡的绝望梦想，您最终会更加沮丧，疲倦和不快乐。 相反，应专注于改善生活质量。 问自己以下问题：

What makes you happy in life?
What is important to you?
Where do you want to be as part of your journey?

Once you answer these questions, you will find ways to live your life to the fullest and also do justice to the work part of your life. Your objective will change from living life from leftover hours of work to achieving enrichment in whatever you do as part of your daily routine.

是什么让您生活快乐？
对你来说什么是重要的？
您想成为旅途的一部分吗？

回答了这些问题后，您将找到使自己的生活充实的方法，并为生活中的工作做正义。 您的目标将从生活中的剩余工作时间变为在日常工作中充实自己的生活。

And here are some ways to do it.

### Prioritize Tasks

优先任务

Prioritizing tasks is all about dividing tasks into four buckets and spending time on the most important tasks — those items which have the most impact.

确定任务的优先级就是将任务分为四个部分，并花时间在最重要的任务上-那些影响最大的项目。

- Urgent and important
- Important but not urgent
- Urgent but not important
- Neither urgent nor important.

- 紧急而重要
- 重要但不紧急
- 紧急但不重要
- 既不紧急也不重要

Here, Warren Buffet, one of the wealthiest and most successful investors in the world, can help us with his 25/5 rule.

在这里，沃伦·巴菲特（Warren Buffet）是世界上最富有，最成功的投资者之一，可以帮助我们遵循他的25/5规则。

- Make a list of your top 25 career/life goals.
- Remain focused on accomplishing goals 1 through 5.
- Stay completely away from working on goals 6 through 25.

- 列出您最重要的25个职业/生活目标。
- 保持专注于实现目标1至5
- 完全远离实现目标6到25的目标

The lesson is simple. You are not going to achieve 25 things in your life. You are only going to complete 3–5 things if you are focused. But you lack the focus because of items 6–25. Buffet’s principle is simple; also list out the items that hold you back so you can focus on the five items that are most important to you.
这课很简单。 您将无法实现生活中的25件事。 如果专注，您只会完成3-5件事。 但是由于第6-25项，您缺乏重点。 巴菲特的原则很简单； 还列出阻碍您前进的项目，这样您就可以专注于对您来说最重要的五个项目。

Do the same thing in your daily or weekly routine.
在您的日常或每周例行中执行相同的操作。

For example, every morning, you might make a task list of 5–10 things you would really like to accomplish for the day.
例如，每天早晨，您可能会列出一份每天要真正完成的5-10项任务。

Then, circle only the top two tasks. Do not do any of the other tasks — no meetings, no calls, nothing — until you have knocked out both the items. Make these top tasks your ultimate priority, and do not let the others get in the way.
然后，仅圈出前两个任务。 在您将两个项目都剔除之前，请勿执行任何其他任务-没有会议，没有电话，什么也没有。 将这些首要任务作为您的最终优先任务，不要让其他任务成为障碍。

The key is undivided focus without distractions. The 25/5 rule helps you accomplish bit by bit every day instead of being overwhelmed by emotions.
关键是专心致志。 25/5规则可帮助您每天一点一点地完成任务，而不会被情绪所淹没。

### Be a 9-to-5 Developer

In eight hours a day, I can still get my work done and do a good job on it. But some of you will not agree with me, giving a lot of reasons:

“I am coding 16 hours a day.”

“My peers are working overtime.”

“My company expects me to work after office hours.”

And so on …

一天八小时，我仍然可以完成工作并做好工作。但是，由于许多原因，有些人不同意我的看法：

“我每天要编码16个小时。”
“我的同伴正在加班。”
“我的公司希望我下班后去工作。”
等等 …

The point is if you are working 9 to 5 and finishing the work on time, that does not make you a bad developer. It just means that you are good at time management. And working longer hours always results in diminishing returns.

关键是，如果您正在9到5进行工作并按时完成工作，那并不意味着您是一个糟糕的开发人员。这仅表示您擅长时间管理。而长时间工作总是会导致收益递减

At the end of a 12-hour day, your mind will start to wander, and you will lose your effectiveness. In fact, Google research has also proved that you will not be more than 10–15% effective in the last four hours. And even if you are a rock-star developer, you will be putting in more than 50% effort to get a maximum of 25% extra work done, which is really not worth it.

在12小时的工作结束时，您的思维将开始漂移，您将失去效力。实际上，Google的研究还证明，您在过去四个小时内的效果不会超过10–15％。即使您是摇滚明星般的开发人员，您也将花费超过50％的精力来完成最多25％的额外工作，这确实不值得

While in some company cultures working overtime might get you a promotion or rewards, the impact on your long-term career is mostly minimal. It is like fighting a pyrrhic battle — you invest a lot, and get very little in return. Avoid this trap, and focus on improving the quality of your life.

在某些公司文化中，加班可能会为您带来升职或奖励，但对您的长期职业的影响通常很小。这就像一场艰苦的战斗-您投入大量资金，却获得很少的回报。避免这种陷阱，并专注于改善生活质量。

That said, emergencies do come when putting in the extra effort is justified, but they are far and few in between. You cannot be in a perpetual emergency situation.

Aim to work 40 hours and go home. That’s it.

话虽如此，当有必要付出额外努力时，紧急事件的确会到来，但它们之间相距甚远。您不能处于永久的紧急情况下。

打算工作40小时并回家。而已。

### Pay Yourself First

Your work will never end. But that can never be an excuse not to pay yourself first.

Just like sleeping, I never used to make time to work out.

But working out is now just part of my weekly routine. I am not big on going to the gym, but I do really like to run. Running allows me to clear my mind. Whenever I feel like I need some inspiration, I run outdoors. Running slows me down, allows me to see the world around me, and gives me a great way to burn off excess stress and gain clarity on my ideas.

您的工作将永无止境。但这绝不是不先付钱的借口。

就像睡觉一样，我从来没有花时间锻炼身体。

但是，现在锻炼只是我每周例行工作的一部分。我不太想去健身房，但我确实很喜欢跑步。跑步让我头脑清醒。每当我觉得需要灵感时，我都会在户外跑步。跑步让我放慢了脚步，让我看到了我周围的世界，并且为我提供了一种消除过多压力，使我的想法清晰的好方法

In the same way, I have now time-boxed intervals of time for investing in freelancing work and my passion projects. Having a side project allows you to stay in control. You play the role of designer and client. A side project is a great way to learn and make some extra cash — and if you are having a horrible day at work, you can always count on your side project to help you stay grounded.

同样，我现在有时间间隔，用于投资自由职业和我的激情项目。拥有辅助项目可以使您保持控制。您扮演设计师和客户的角色。辅助项目是学习和赚取额外现金的好方法-如果您在工作中度过了糟糕的一天，则始终可以依靠辅助项目来帮助您保持扎实的基础。

Wake up an hour early every day, and devote the freshest hour only to yourself and your ambitions. It is your time; don’t allow anything or anyone to steal it from you. If you want more time, take the time, but spend the most productive hour of the day paying yourself first.

每天早上醒来一个小时，只把最新鲜的时间献给自己和您的野心。这是你的时间；禁止任何东西或任何人从您那里窃取它。如果您想要更多时间，请花些时间，但要花一天中最有成效的时间先付钱。

Once you start living life this way, the quality of your life will increase, and you never will have to worry about adjusting life within the leftover hours of work.

一旦开始这样的生活，生活质量就会提高，而您将不必担心在剩余的工作时间内调整生活

### Lastly, Quit All WhatsApp Groups

Yes, I really mean it. WhatsApp groups are the biggest source of distraction in today’s connected world.

These groups started out as a helpful addition to the messaging app, but the situation went mad. At one point in time, I was in 12 regular official groups and about 40 ad hoc semi-formal ones.

是的，我是真的。 WhatsApp小组是当今互联世界中最大的干扰源。

这些小组起初是对消息传递应用程序的有益补充，但情况变得发疯了。在某个时间点上，我参加了12个正式的正式团体和大约40个临时的半正式团体。

Then there are family groups: immediate family and extended family, with baby photos often appearing on duplicate across them. What can you do? You have to respond! “So adorable! She is so big already! (emoji with heart eyes).” My brother has a long-term girlfriend but isn’t married yet, so we have two groups of differing levels of familiarity — one with her, one without. (Sadly, the chats are interchangeable — no one knows why this charade even exists.)

然后是家庭组：直系亲属和大家庭，婴儿照经常出现在他们的重复照片上。你能做什么？你必须回应！ “那么可爱！她已经很大了！ （我的表情带有心脏的眼睛。）我的兄弟有一个长期的女友，但还没有结婚，所以我们有两组不同程度的熟悉程度-一组与她，另一组没有。 （可悲的是，聊天是可以互换的，没人知道为什么这样的伪装甚至存在。）

And a major cause of burnout is listening and responding to every notification that stems from these groups.

倦怠的主要原因是倾听和响应来自这些群体的每条通知。

The worst part is: You cannot leave. It is a mortal sin! The social consequences of “Ravi has left the group” far outweigh wading through the emoji chatter. It is the equivalent of turning your back and walking away.

最糟糕的是：你不能离开。这是致命的罪恶！通过表情符号聊天，“ Ravi离开了团队”的社会后果远不止于此。这相当于转过身走开。

That is why, one fine day, I just exited all groups at once. If someone wants to reach me, they can text me a message. I can choose to answer if required whenever I want to. I am in control now.

这就是为什么有一天，我一次退出了所有小组。如果有人想联系我，他们可以给我发消息。如果需要，我可以选择回答。我现在控制住了。

So many of us maintain relationships just for the heck of it knowing very well these relationships bring us more grief than enjoyment. I am not telling you to cut off all relationships; all I am saying is to prioritize which relationships you want and which you want to avoid.

因此，我们中的许多人只是出于对社交关系的渴望，他们非常了解这些关系给我们带来的痛苦多于享受。我不是在告诉你切断所有关系。我要说的是优先考虑您想要的和想要避免的关系。

The more the quality of your nonworking life improves, the more you are free to live life to the fullest. Pay attention to the other (physical) people in your room rather than devoting time to answering all your (virtual) notifications.

您的非工作生活质量改善得越多，您就有更多的自由度过充实的生活。请注意房间中的其他（身体）人，而不要花时间回答所有（虚拟）通知。

As Marissa Mayer has rightly said:

*“You can’t have everything you want, but you can have the things that really matter to you."*

正如玛丽莎·梅耶（Marissa Mayer）正确地说的那样：

*“您无法拥有想要的一切，但您可以拥有真正重要的事物”*
