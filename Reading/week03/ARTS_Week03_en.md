Skills that are reshaping and redefining the workplace



According to [research](https://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/future-of-organizations-and-work/what-the-future-of-work-will-mean-for-jobs-skills-and-wages) from McKinsey, nearly one-third of U.S. workers will [need to find new jobs by 2030](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/29/one-third-of-us-workers-could-be-jobless-by-2030-due-to-automation.html) in response to rapid advancements in technology. These advancements mean that workers need to constantly be learning new skills.

Look, when it comes down to it, I am passionate about a handful of things: good quality beer (just kidding…but seriously you can mail me your local IPAs), leadership and management, economics and consumer behavior, entrepreneurship and start-ups, and lastly technology and gadgets. The technology one stands out, as I work full-time managing product marketing for the [global process intelligence](https://abbyy.com/timeline) division of [ABBYY Software](https://www.abbyy.com/company/key-facts/). My passion in technology means that YES! I have one of those smart doohickies on my wrist and a household enabled with voice-controlled thermostats and other fancy smart devices. The way technology trends change so quickly and new ‘cool stuff’ evolves so quickly keeps me up reading articles and watching snippets from[ CES 2020 live](https://www.cnet.com/news/ces-2020-the-latest-from-toyota-dell-amd-and-more-live-from-las-vegas/) eager to learn “What is next?”. Talking all things technology and following my previous article about [The Top 10 Technology Trends for 2020](https://towardsdatascience.com/top-10-technology-trends-for-2020-4a179fdd53b1), I wanted to discuss the top 10 trending technology skills for 2020 and beyond.

Strategies and things that will change the way we think and work

You know the stakes are changing and so do I. I don’t think any of these top skills are going to come as a surprise to you, but they’re worth mentioning in your next management or leadership meeting. The demand for technology, and more so for workers with advanced technology skills are skyrocketing. With large-scale disruption happening across the enterprise, organizations need to respond in brand new, innovative ways. This means rethinking how we approach workforce skills and talent management. Many companies are putting more resources into recruiting, hiring and nurturing the right talent to remain competitive. Make no mistake about it, this means that employees willing to put time into developing advanced tech skills may have an advantage in landing some of the most in-demand roles in the enterprise in the next 12 months.

According to a [2019 report from iCIMS](https://cdn31.icims.com/icims3/prod/pdf/misc/2019-Benchmark-on-Hiring-Tech-Talent.pdf), a recruitment software company, it took organizations an average of 55 days to fill a tech role in 2016. In 2019, that number jumped to 66 days. According to the report, these unfilled roles can cost about $680 in lost revenue per day per vacancy. The supply is slim and demand for these tech jobs is high! Are you qualified with the skills to get these positions?
